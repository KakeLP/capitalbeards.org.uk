title: St. Wilgefortis Day - July 20th 2014
---

The Capital Beards will next meet along with the rest of [The British Beard Club](http://thebritishbeardclub.org) on July 20th for [St. Wilgefortis's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilgefortis)
feast day. St Wilgefortis is a notably bearded saint which is why we try to meet
up on her feast day.

The venue is yet to be determined because our normal choice is shut on a Sunday
but will be somewhere near Westminster Abbey which has a statue of St. Wilgefortis.
