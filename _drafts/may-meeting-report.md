On the 24th of May 2014 the [Capital Beards](http://capitalbeards.org.uk) met in
the [Old Coffee House](http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Old_Coffee_House,_W1F_9SF) for their
May meeting. 9 existing members turned up and we enrolled another 2 while we
were there.

The main topic for discussion was Nick's proposed design for our new logo. It is
almost ready to be revealed but there were a couple of changes that Nick has yet
to make.

A lot of beer was drunk and food consumed at the Old Coffee House before we ventured
off for a mini pub crawl to the [Harp](http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Harp,_WC2N_4HS).
The highlight being able to drink a pint of Trooper in a [Trooper glass](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rjw1/14261679862).

At the [Harp](http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Harp,_WC2N_4HS) we met a fine bearded gentleman from San Francisco.
