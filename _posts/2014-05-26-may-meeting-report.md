On the 24th of May 2014 the [Capital Beards](http://capitalbeards.org.uk) met in
the [Old Coffee House](http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Old_Coffee_House,_W1F_9SF) for our
May meeting. Nine existing members turned up and we enrolled another two while we
were there.

The main topic for discussion was Nick's proposed design for our new logo. It's
almost ready to be revealed, but Nick still has a couple of changes to make.

A lot of beer was drunk and food consumed at the Old Coffee House before we ventured
off for a mini pub crawl to the [Harp](http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Harp,_WC2N_4HS).
The highlight of this was being able to drink a pint of Trooper in a [Trooper glass](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rjw1/14261679862).

At the [Harp](http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Harp,_WC2N_4HS) we met a fine bearded gentleman from San Francisco.
