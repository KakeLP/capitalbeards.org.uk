title: St Wilgefortis’ Day — July 20th 2014
---

The Capital Beards will next meet along with the rest of [The British Beard Club](http://thebritishbeardclub.org) on July 20th for [St Wilgefortis’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilgefortis)
feast day. St Wilgefortis is a notably bearded saint, and so we try to meet
up on her feast day every year.

Our venue will be the [Buckingham Arms](http://www.youngs.co.uk/pubs/buckingham-arms) on Petty France. A pub notable for being one of only two in London to have been in every edition of [CAMRA's](http://www.camra.org.uk) [Good Beer Guide](http://www.camra.org.uk/gbg).

As normal we should be there from about Midday.
